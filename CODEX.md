## MVP — Status: ✅ Complete
**Goal:** Deliver a fast, memory-safe regex engine with the essentials.

- [x] Parser handles literals, quantifiers (`*`, `+`, `?`, `{n,m}`), alternation, and character classes
- [x] NFA builder constructs working graphs for supported syntax
- [x] Matcher executes NFA programs and exposes `isMatch`, `find`, `findAll`
- [x] Baseline streaming matcher scaffolding without crash regressions
- [x] Build system exports a reusable module plus CLI stub (`zig build run`)
- [x] Core docs: README + API + Examples + Performance quickstart
- [x] Foundational automated tests (literals, quantifiers, streaming smoke)

---

## Alpha — Status: ✅ Complete
**Goal:** Close functional gaps so developers can rely on zregex for day-to-day work.

- [x] Enforce `^` / `$` anchors during matching (NFA matcher + streaming matcher)
- [x] Implement capture group tracking end-to-end (`Match.groups`, group AST/NFA wiring)
- [x] Support non-capturing groups `(?:...)` in the parser and builder
- [x] Improve parser diagnostics with line/column error reporting
- [x] Expand unit tests for anchors, groups, alternation, and quantifier edge cases
- [x] Track true match boundaries in streaming mode and expose chunk-aware slices
- [x] Wire build options (`capture_groups`, `streaming`, `jit`, etc.) into runtime feature toggles
- [x] Ship a simple CLI (`zregex`) for interactive pattern testing (read pattern + input)
- [x] Optimize character class matching hot path (ASCII fast path, Unicode hook)
- [x] Refresh architecture overview doc (parser → NFA → matcher flow, memory model)

**Exit Criteria:** All checkboxes above are complete and green CI for the new tests.

## Using This CODEX

- Treat checklists as living documents; update statuses as work lands.
- Keep `TODO.md` focused on the current sprint/backlog while CODEX tracks the long arc.
- When adding new features, place them in the earliest phase where they provide value, then trickle repercussions into later phases as needed.
